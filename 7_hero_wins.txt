George was not called "Insanity" for nothing.
When he finally reaches the top of the highest mountain
he realises that there is nothing there, exept a mirror
that refuses to fall from the winds and chaos around it.
When George squints into the mirror, trying not to fall down
to a certain death, he sees that the horrible villain is
in fact himself!

Stunned by the realisation, he falls to his knees, 
closes his eyes and starts to cry...

When he opens his eyes, he sees his mother putting down
the book with big letters printed on it "GIT of SCRIPTSVILLE".
